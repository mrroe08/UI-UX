# Eheim Fishtank heater

## By Mason Roe 2/25/2022

Below you will see a fish tank heater made by Eheim that I use in one of my fish tanks. The usability of this is really simple and quite **memorable.** Simply turn the dial to adjust the temperature in the tank. If you need to adjust it at any time just rotate it and the change is as easy as that. The device is also very **learnable** as it is very easy to see the temperature it is set at and easier to adjust by just the twist of the knob. This makes for great **natural mapping,** or the relation between controls to the outcome of this action. 

However, what is not quite as easy to learn is when the device is off vs when it is on. This is seen by a little orange light that turns on when the heater is heating. Though, if you do not know that the light is there it is really easy to put the heater in the tank in such a way that you block it, thus never knowing when it is heating or not.

In addition to the **learnability** and **memorability** the device is **effective** and **efficient.** The device accomplishes these by heating up only when there is a drop in temperature and cutting off heat when that temperature is reached. Unfortunately, though this is where **safety** and **error tolerance** get a bit tricky. 

The biggest **safety** concern is that it is semi-common for tank heaters to fail, whether it be due to a power surge or just bad luck. When it does fail the device has no way to stop heating itself, and can quickly overheat the tank causing your fish to die.  It would be really nice if there was some **safety** feature here to prevent that. I think the best thing to prevent this issue is to include a separate temperature device that holds the power of the heater entirely, if the temperature gets too high it kills the power to the heater and thus not allowing it to heat. In addition, you have no idea when this will happen it could happen a day after use or never thus making it less **error tolerant** than desired.

The device is also more or less **satisfying.** It does exactly what it's intended to do and keeps the fish tank heated. Having your fish tank heated is extremely **useful** for various fish. As tropical fish enjoy much warmer water than room temp, somewhere between 75-80 degrees on average. Overall the device is good at doing what it sets out to do though the lack of **error tolerance** and **safety** features leave a bit to be desired.
