# Apple's App Store for Mac

## By Mason Roe 5/16/2022

Apple's app store is one of the most recognizable & **memorable** app stores across any platform. This is for good reason. The app store implements a very simple UI with various categories on the left along with a search bar. On the right you will see various apps based on the search you have completed or category you have chose. Once you have used the app store for even a few minutes you know exactly how to use it, making it very **learnable.**

However, that is not all. When selecting and downloading an app the system is quite **efficient.** Simply click download and enter your password, or better yet use face ID / your fingerprint. And then the app just starts to download and install. You can also see how far along the download is with a simple wheel design. This makes for a quite **satisfying** experience overall.

The nature of the password requirement makes this pretty **safe.** Safety is in nature how safe it is for the user to use an application, and in this case even if you do try to accidentally purchase something the password requirement means it is safe from this error.

Finally, lets talk about it's **effectiveness** which is my favorite part of the app store. It really does just work, there is nothing but easy to understand mechanics and there is something to be said for that. Downloading an app is easy to understand and gets the job done well. After the installation is done you can simply launch the app from the store or your computer.
