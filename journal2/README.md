# Steam by Valve

## By Mason Roe 4/14/2022

Steam is a free application that allows users to purchase, download, and launch games through it. It is generally regarded as the best in its class and that is for good reason. The application is super **learnable**. It does this by seperating tab's into simple features. You have Store, Library, Community, and your profile which shows up as your username. This makes it super easy to understand what you are clicking on and from there you get options to more features. Such as a search bar for the store, and your library. 

On top of this Steam is super **memorable**. Once you have used Steam even for 15 or so minutes you know just about everything you need to know to use it. From then on, you never really have to relearn the application, if you want to buy a new game you know to go to the store, if you want to boot up a game you have installed you know to go to your library etc.

This app is also extremely **efficient**, downloads are simple and speedy (depending on your internet), purchasing something is **safe** and easy, and finally the app doesn't make you jump through hoops for anything. For example, you can search in the store by deals, genres etc. Or you can search for exactly what you want. Additionally in your library, you can filter to things you have installed, or all games in your library or just the last few games you played. This all makes the application very **efficient** and easy to use. Below you can see the store page.

Finally, to say that the application is **effective** would be an understatement, as I mentioned before there are no hoops to jump through. Steam does exactly what it sets out to do. Nothing more and nothing less, and the fact that Steam has been around since 2003 really shows how you can make an application that is just about perfect, support it and it can stand the test of time.
